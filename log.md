3. Finish incomplete codepen projects (including FCC ones)

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: August 22, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamps tribute page and started on the Survey Form. Wanted to get all of the tests out of the way before I added my own stuff. I do plan on making a form related to one piece.

**Thoughts**: Simple day, mainly just thinking how to apply tags and css to get the output that I wanted. I am still proud of my progress.

### Day 2: August 23, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Survey form on FCC and began on the javascript algorithms certification.

**Thoughts**: Another simple day, FCC starts out pretty slow, but it will start picking up later down the line

### Day 3: August 24, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Product Landing Page for FCC. Basically memorized flex box considering how often I went to the page

**Thoughts**: I did spend 3 hours on this, which was surprising, but I did enjoy thinking of ways to use what I already knew before starting this. I did look up how to do stuff often, but more of it was just me double checking my knowledge.

### Day 5: August 26, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started on the technical documentation page on FCC. Only prepped some of the markup to check of a majority of the chests, I plan to start on the css tomorrow. Also did a few javascript challenges.

**Thoughts**: Fun day

### Day 6: August 27, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the technical documentation page. Managed to complete the navbar and started adding content to the page. Also figured out how to do something cool with the code tags in css

**Thoughts**: Great day, actually enjoyed trying to solve the problems that I came across. I hope to finish this project tomorrow so I can start on the portfolio page one, which im am going to do in my own editor

### Day 7: August 28, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the technical documentation page. I opted to not go with a lot of css this time around, because I felt a plain look fitted what I had. I do want to go back and add more styling later on though. I also started on my personal portfolio.

**Thoughts**: Fun day, I did spend most of my hour looking at resources though, so I was a bit dissatisfied with my progress, but it'll be fine. I do want to go above and beyond for my personal portfolio though, so I might design some stuff in adobe xd or figma before really starting.

### Day 8: August 29, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my portfolio page. Today, I just made sure passed as many of the tests I could before going wild. I chose a color scheme and got almost all of the markup done.

**Thoughts**: Fun day, really exited to be working on this project, since I can customize it like I want to. For now, I'm going to go with something simple, but I definitly want to expand on it later, maybe even changing it to react or whatever else I happen to be learning

### Took a break because I was afraid of a hurricane

### Day 9: September 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the javascript algorithm certification on freecode camp. I do move a bit slower through the code while streaming.

**Thoughts**: I take more time on each challenge since I'm explaining my thought process out loud. While this is a bit slower than the speed I usually go at, I do end up remembering what I've learned, which is helpful

### Day 10: September 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the javascript section of challenges. I also made some headway into the es6 challenges as well

**Thoughts**: Finally getting into more familiar territory with the es6 challenges. That said there are a few things that I didn't know. Thinking aloud does help with that though, so I can pick up on that stuff easier.

### Day 11: September 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Decided to not work on the freecodecamp challenges. Wanted to work on my portfolio and make it better. I did manage to add browsersync, gulp, and sass to my project, which is pretty cool.

**Thoughts**: Even though I didn't get started on my portfolio, I still felt like I learned a lot this time. Again, listening to myself outloud is very helpful, and even though I missed simple things that I spent half an hour trying to find, it was a good learning experience.
