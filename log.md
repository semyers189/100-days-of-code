### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: August 22, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamps tribute page and started on the Survey Form. Wanted to get all of the tests out of the way before I added my own stuff. I do plan on making a form related to one piece.

**Thoughts**: Simple day, mainly just thinking how to apply tags and css to get the output that I wanted. I am still proud of my progress.

### Day 2: August 23, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Survey form on FCC and began on the javascript algorithms certification.

**Thoughts**: Another simple day, FCC starts out pretty slow, but it will start picking up later down the line

### Day 3: August 24, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Product Landing Page for FCC. Basically memorized flex box considering how often I went to the page

**Thoughts**: I did spend 3 hours on this, which was surprising, but I did enjoy thinking of ways to use what I already knew before starting this. I did look up how to do stuff often, but more of it was just me double checking my knowledge.

### Day 5: August 26, Monday

**Thoughts**: Fun day

### Day 6: August 27, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the technical documentation page. Managed to complete the navbar and started adding content to the page. Also figured out how to do something cool with the code tags in css

**Thoughts**: Great day, actually enjoyed trying to solve the problems that I came across. I hope to finish this project tomorrow so I can start on the portfolio page one, which im am going to do in my own editor
