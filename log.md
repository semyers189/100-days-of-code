### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: August 22, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamps tribute page and started on the Survey Form. Wanted to get all of the tests out of the way before I added my own stuff. I do plan on making a form related to one piece.

**Thoughts**: Simple day, mainly just thinking how to apply tags and css to get the output that I wanted. I am still proud of my progress.
